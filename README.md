# ONLYOFFICE app for Dropbox

ONLYOFFICE app for Dropbox allows working with office files directly within [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/).

## How it works

ONLYOFFICE integration app allows users to open and edit the existing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations within Dropbox.

Click the 3 dots icon to launch the file context menu, find **Open in**, and select the **ONLYOFFICE Docs** option. The corresponding ONLYOFFICE editor will open in a new tab in the full screen mode.

_**Please note**: the app uses the pre-configured tenant of ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud and doesn't require any additional configuration._
