# ONLYOFFICE app for Dropbox

The **ONLYOFFICE app for Dropbox** allows users to **open, view, and edit** office files directly within their [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) workspace using [ONLYOFFICE online editors](https://www.onlyoffice.com/docs).

## ▶️ How it works

With this integration, Dropbox users can work on their office documents without leaving Dropbox:

1. Click the **three-dots menu (⋮)** to open the file context menu.
2. Select **Open in → ONLYOFFICE Docs**.
3. The selected document, spreadsheet, or presentation will open in a new browser tab using the corresponding ONLYOFFICE editor in full-screen mode.

> ✍️ **Note:** This app uses a **pre-configured ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud tenant**, so there’s no need for manual configuration.

## ⚙️ Installation guide

Easily connect ONLYOFFICE to your Dropbox account by following these steps:

1. Sign in to your [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) account.
2. Go to the [Dropbox App Center](https://www.dropbox.com/apps).
3. Search for **ONLYOFFICE Docs** and open the app page.
4. Click **Connect** or **Add integration**.
5. Grant the requested permissions to link your Dropbox with ONLYOFFICE Docs.

Once connected, you can start opening and editing supported files directly from your Dropbox interface.

> ⚠️ **Tip:** To manage or disconnect the integration later, visit **Settings → Connected Apps** in your Dropbox account and select **Disconnect**.

## 📁 Supported file formats

| ODT, ODP, ODS, TXT, CSV, RTF, EPUB, FB2      | Viewable; editing may require conversion to OOXML to prevent data loss. |
